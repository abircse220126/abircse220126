## Engineering Focus

Designing and delivering **production-ready web systems** with a strong emphasis on **scalability, maintainability, and performance**.  
My work spans frontend engineering, backend API development, and full-stack system integration using modern JavaScript technologies.

I focus on building systems that are:
- Modular and extensible  
- Secure by design  
- Optimized for real-world usage  
- Easy to maintain and scale over time
